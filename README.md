# Restaurant

This app represents a menu of a restaurant. First, the user can choose which category: entrees or appetizers. When the user chooses, a new list is displayed in which the category-dishes are visible.
When the user clicks on a dish, more details about it will be displayed on the screen (e.g. a short description and the price).
